# Operator requests — the standing backlog

> **Ken, 2026-08-20:** *"Where do you need to put these requests so they just
> get auto-repeated over and over again so I don't have to keep requesting they
> be done over and over again?"*

**Here.** This file is the answer, and this section is the contract.

## The contract

1. **Every request you make goes in this file, the moment you make it**, before
   any work starts on it. Not into a chat reply, not into a session summary,
   not into an agent's memory — into this file, which is in git, on disk,
   backed up, and read at the start of every session.
2. **Only you close a row.** I may move a row to *shipped-and-driven*; the row
   does not leave this file until you have used it and said so. A row I believe
   is done but you have not confirmed sits under **Shipped — awaiting your
   verdict**, not deleted.
3. **A row carries evidence, not a claim.** *"Done"* is not a status. The
   status is either a driven check by name, or a dated note saying exactly what
   was verified and how. If nobody drove it, it says NOT VERIFIED, in those
   words.
4. **A blocked row names what blocks it and where that is filed.** If it is an
   engine gap, the row names the file in
   `D:\Dev\FeatureRequests\pdfce_FeatureRequests\open\`. A row that says
   "blocked" with nothing behind it is a row I have not done the work on.
5. **Nothing is silently rescoped.** If I ship half of what you asked for, the
   row stays open and says which half.

## Why this file and not something cleverer

The failure this fixes is real and it is mine: a request made in conversation
lives exactly as long as the conversation. Sessions end, context is compacted,
and an ask made in turn three of a long session is gone by turn thirty — which
is why you have had to repeat yourself. The agent-memory system is for *how you
work*; it is the wrong shape for *what you asked for*, because memories get
summarised and requests must not.

A file in the repository has none of those properties. It is read at session
start alongside `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, it survives compaction because it is on
disk, and its history is in git so a row cannot quietly disappear.

# ★★★ THE OPERATOR'S CURRENT DIRECTION — 2026-08-20

> *"put the text editing aside again. In the next version I just need the
> perimeter measuring tool to work with the group scale stuff the same as the
> other dimensioning tools have."*

**O1 is PARKED at his instruction.** Not closed, not solved — parked. The
findings stand and the engine request stays open. Do not pick it back up
without him.

**O3, the perimeter tool, is the single deliverable for the next build.** The
engine shipped its whole half on 2026-08-20; everything left is shell work.

## And the standing criticism, recorded rather than argued with

> *"We'll have to reconsider how you are going about the canvas later since it
> shouldn't take multiple 3 hour sessions each day to figure out how to get a
> cursor to move and edit text on it, or get shortcuts to work for basic
> functions."*

He is right and this belongs at the top of the file where it cannot be missed.
Two observations that are mine to act on, not his to have to make again:

1. **The basics were never audited as basics.** Ctrl+P had never been bound. A
   text caret had no index. Both are things every application in this class has
   on day one, and both were found by him rather than by us — because every
   test asked "does the thing I built work?" and nothing asked "does the thing
   everyone expects exist?". The keymap now has a list-shaped gate for exactly
   this reason. The canvas needs the same treatment and does not have it yet.
2. **Sessions have been spent diagnosing, not building.** Three of today's
   findings were engine defects that presented as shell defects, and each cost
   hours to localise. That is partly the boundary and partly that the driven
   checks were reading traces rather than pixels — a trace can say the verb ran
   and cannot say the screen changed. Two checks were fixed today to stop
   producing confident wrong diagnoses. That is the pattern to keep pulling on.

# OPEN

## O14 — The conventions sweep, 2026-08-20: fourteen gaps, found by asking

**Asked:** by you, as *"how can you learn from these other programs so that you
can build the missing parts more effectively?"*
**Status:** the mechanism is built. These are what it found on its first run.

`D:/dev/rag/ui-conventions/` is a corpus of five gesture classes — what every
program in the class already does, where the rule comes from, and the failure
mode when it is absent. `tools/gates/check-conventions.sh` makes each
interactive surface answer every row of its class, in its own source, and fails
the build on an unanswered one. Eleven surfaces registered; all eleven now
answer.

It cannot check behaviour and does not pretend to. It checks that **the question
was asked** — which is the whole of the problem, because every convention you
have had to report was one nobody had asked about rather than one somebody
decided against.

### What it found. None of this was known before today.

**Direct manipulation**

1. **Shift does not preserve aspect on a resize.** *The* resize convention, in
   every program in the class, absent here.
2. Shift does not constrain a move, a handle drag or a dimension drag to an axis.
3. **A vertex drag does not snap**, while the tool that placed that vertex does
   — so you can pick a corner onto geometry and then be unable to put it back.
4. Neither a move, a resize nor a handle drag snaps to guides, grid or geometry.
5. **No rotate handle** anywhere. Blocked on the engine verb, which is accepted
   and being built.
6. **No right-click to add or remove a perimeter point**, though both engine
   verbs and the preflight that greys the menu item already exist.
7. A zero-travel release still raises an action in three of the four drag paths.

**Selection**

8. **Only ce dimensions hit-test their real shape.** A `/Square` with no interior
   colour still claims its interior, so a large empty callout box is
   un-clickable-through. The mechanism to fix it now exists — that subtype needs
   a shape.

**Text**

9. ~~No live preview while typing~~ — **FIXED 2026-08-20.** An in-place editor
   box, sized to what you type, with the caret measured against the text as
   drawn. The design had always intended the characters to be shown *off-canvas
   in the status bar* and that half was never built, so they appeared nowhere at
   all.
10. Caret indices are characters, not grapheme clusters, so a combining mark or
    an emoji takes two presses. `unicode-segmentation` is already in the tree.
11. **No selection inside a draft** — no Shift+arrow, no Ctrl+A, no drag-select.

**Dialogs**

12. **No dialog is a real OS window** — your report. egui can already do it via
    `show_viewport_immediate`; the in-viewport panel was the path of least
    resistance and nothing pushed back.
13. **Enter is not the affirmative default** in any dialog, and no button is
    drawn as the default. Type in the last field, press Enter, nothing happens.
14. No dialog remembers where you moved it; every one re-centres. Tab order and
    modal focus-trapping are untested.

### And two fixed on the spot, because writing the row exposed them

- The vertex drag converted screen→canvas **twice**, so it tracked at `1/zoom`
  and sat off by the scroll origin — *"the distance from the pointer varies as
  you move it."* Fixed.
- It also assigned the pointer straight to the vertex, so grabbing a handle
  slightly off-centre teleported the corner under the cursor before you had
  moved it. Now it moves by the delta and the grab point is preserved.

## O8 — **A Save button.** Not Save As. Save.

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"can I please have a save button like every other
program in existence has? We're on week two of this and just have a save as
button."*
**Status:** **SHIPPED 2026-08-20 and DRIVEN.** Awaiting your verdict.

`Ctrl+S` saves over the file you opened. `Ctrl+Shift+S` is Save-a-copy. The
quick-access toolbar's second slot is Save now, and it carries the disk glyph;
Save-a-copy renders as text.

It writes to a temporary beside your file and then renames, so a crash or a full
disk in the middle leaves your original untouched rather than half-written. And
because pdfce saves incrementally, the previous version of the document stays
inside the file — nothing is thrown away by pressing it.

Driven: `save_writes_over_the_file_you_opened` — the file grew 140,660 →
141,423 bytes, no temporary was left behind, and it still reads as a page tree.

★ The blocker that kept this out for a fortnight said *"in-place save is blocked
on autosave and crash recovery"*. That was aimed at the wrong hazard: pdfce's
incremental format already WAS the crash recovery. What was actually unsafe was
the write, and that has a three-line answer nobody had written because nobody
was asking. Third time in two days that a blocker turned out to be a question
asked wrongly.

There is no defence for how long it took. `Ctrl+S` is bound to `file.save_copy`, which asks where to
put it, every time. Overwrite-in-place was written down as *"an operator scope
decision"* and then sat there being nobody's problem — which is the same failure
as `Ctrl+P` never being bound and the caret never having an index: **the basics
were never audited as basics**, because every test asked "does the thing I built
work?" and nothing asked "does the thing everyone expects exist?".

## O9 — A **length** tool: the perimeter tool that never closes

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"add a length tool that works like the perimeter tool
without needing to close the profile."*
**Status:** **SHIPPED 2026-08-20 and DRIVEN.** Awaiting your verdict.

Measure ▸ **Length**, beside Perimeter. Same gesture, same snapping, same
preview, same running total, same group scale — it just never closes. Clicking
the first point again adds a point there, because a run of cable that loops back
is still a run of cable. Double-click the last point to finish.

It is a separate control rather than a checkbox on Perimeter because "Perimeter"
says closed, and nobody measuring a pipe run would go looking inside it.

Driven, in the same check as Perimeter and deliberately so: what is worth
proving about Length is a *negative* relative to Perimeter — that the
first-vertex click does **not** close it — and a negative is only meaningful
beside the positive it differs from. Two separate checks would let the pair
drift into being one tool.

```
★ the ring closed and the dimension reached the engine   (Perimeter)
★ the Length tool took all 5 clicks as vertices          (Length)
```

## O10 — Neither measuring tool previews while you trace

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"both these tools need a preview just like the measure
tool has."*
**Status:** **FIXED 2026-08-20**, awaiting your verdict.

The preview arm was written and unit-tested for its segments, and it was
**unreachable**: `super::preview` returns early on
`MeasureState::gesture_in_progress()`, and that function had not learned about
the perimeter's pick. So the tool drew nothing at all while tracing.

It is the failure class this project keeps meeting — every part correct, the
*join* unobserved — and the driven check could not see it, because that check
asserts on the trace and a preview is pixels. `every_pick_kind_is_counted_as_a_gesture`
is now the guard.

## O11 — Move, resize and rotate a placed image on the canvas

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"there was no way to reposition, resize, or rotate it
on the screen. Can I please please please have that too?"*
**Status:** OPEN. **Blocked on the engine, filed 2026-08-20**:
`request_no_verb_transforms_a_non_path_object_so_a_placed_image_cannot_be_moved.md`.

`EditSession::move_objects` — the verb the canvas drag already reaches — is
**path-only**, by name and on purpose. There is no verb anywhere in the engine
that moves, scales or rotates an image or a text object.

**O11 and O12 are one gap**, and I asked for it as one verb rather than three.
In a content stream a placed image and a placed text run are the same shape —
an object emitted under a transformation matrix — so move, resize and rotate
are all "pre-multiply that matrix", and building them separately would give me
two call sites for one gesture.

Everything on my side is already built and waiting: the selection model, the
eight grips, the ghost preview. `canvas::resizing` computes the scale factors
from a grip drag today and commits them for paths only. That is exactly the
hole.

## O12 — Move text after placing it

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"can I please please please have the capability to move
the text after?"*
**Status:** OPEN, and it is **the same gap as O11** — filed together, one verb.
See that row.

## O13 — Insert image does not appear until you save and reopen

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"I tried a new document and inserted an image. Nothing
appeared on screen or in the tree, but after saving and reopening the image was
there."*
**Status:** **FIXED 2026-08-20 and DRIVEN.** Awaiting your verdict.

Your report split O4 in two, and this half was mine.

After every edit the shell re-walks the page tree and then compared *(page
object id, rotation)* against what it had. If nothing there moved it returned
early, with a comment saying *"the page vector already describes the
document"*. **That is false.** A `Page` is not an id — it is a resolved page,
with its `/Contents` and `/Resources` in it. `add_image` turns `/Contents` from
a stream into an array and adds an `/XObject`; the page's id does not move; the
early return fired; the canvas and the Objects panel went on reading a page as
it was before the edit.

Which is why saving and reopening worked: the bytes were right the whole time.

Markup never showed it (annotations are read from the session, not that vector)
and moving an object never showed it (that rewrites a stream *in place*, so the
stale reference still resolves to the right object). `add_image` is the first
verb that changes what `/Contents` **is**, so the bug had been there since it
was written and had never been reachable in a way anyone could see.

Driven, on your own JPEG, into a new document from the template:

```
made a blank document first
placed: add-image page=0 n=1 — 839 dpi
the page repainted: 118,580 of 256,878 pixels changed
```

and the Objects panel now reads *"1 object(s) on this page — 1 image(s). #0
Image · 6247 × 5010 px"*.

**O4 is still open** — that one is the engine corrupting `/Contents` when it is
already an indirect array, which is what your CAD sheets use, and it produces a
file pdfce cannot reopen at all. Filed and unchanged.


## O1 — Editing text on the canvas, and editing text in a text box

**Asked:** repeatedly; restated 2026-08-20 — *"Still no editing text on top of
the canvas. Or editing text on a text box."*
**Status:** OPEN. Under investigation 2026-08-20; nothing claimed.

Two distinct things and I have been conflating them, which is probably part of
why it keeps coming back:

- **(a) Editing text that is already on the page** — click a run of existing
  page text, get a caret, retype it.
- **(b) Editing the text inside a text box you have added** — a `/FreeText`
  annotation, or a text object this shell authored: double-click it, get a
  caret in it, retype.

**(a) — driven 2026-08-20 on your own CAD drawing. It is reproduced, and it is
not the shell.** `text_edit_on_a_real_drawing`:

```
text-edit-caret kind=Edit page=0 run=44 len=1     ← the caret lands on real text
text-edit-typing draft=true text_events=1 len=2   ← keystrokes reach the draft
text-edit-typing draft=true text_events=1 len=3
text-edit-plan page=0 run=44 disposition=Pin reason=Rotated pinned=true
edit-text-refused page=0 n=1
  detail=text to edit ("p") was not found in an editable run on the page
```

So the tool arms, the caret lands on the right run, the typing arrives, the plan
is built and the commit reaches the engine — **and `pdfce-core` refuses it.**
From your chair that is precisely "the tool responds and the page does not
change".

Root cause under investigation 2026-08-20. It will be either an engine gap (a
request, filed) or a wrong call on my side (a fix). Either way this row records
the answer.

★ And a second defect found in the process, on my side: the driven check for
this was reporting *"THE COMMIT NEVER REACHED THE ENGINE"* — which was **false**.
`edit-text-refused` is not `edit-text`, so a check asserting on the absence of a
line produced a confident, specific, wrong accusation about working code. Fixed:
a refusal is now asked about first and quoted verbatim.

**(c) — the caret cannot be moved inside a run. FIXED 2026-08-20**, and it was
worse than it looked: there was **no caret index at all**. The draft appended
text and Backspace popped the last character, so the painter drew its line at
the right edge of the run's box because that is the only position an
append-only draft has.

Now: a real caret. Click part-way into a run and it lands at that character
(measured against the run's own glyph advances); Left, Right, Home, End,
Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right move it; Delete eats forwards; typing and Backspace
act at the caret. Unit-tested, including your `SHEET 1 OF 4` case as a named
test. **NOT yet driven** — the harness was blocked by the on-screen keyboard.

**No selection yet** — no Shift+arrow, no Ctrl+A, no drag-select inside a
draft. That is a second feature and it is row **O7** rather than an implied gap.

**(a) — the cause is found, and it is the engine.** Your text lives inside a
form XObject; `pdfce-core` edits page-stream text only, which is a named
non-goal of that cut. The shell was reading the byte span of a show operator
and discarding the field that says *which content stream the span indexes*, so
it pinned into the wrong buffer and the engine reported "text not found" about
text that was plainly there.

Measured on the benchmark drawing: **1,696 show operators of real drawing text
inside the form, against 3,007 metadata glyphs in the page's own stream.** So
on your documents this is the majority case, not an edge case — which is why it
has read as "does nothing" every time.

Shipped today, and it is not a fix: the caret is now **refused before it takes
a keystroke**, with a sentence on the status row. That converts a caret that
silently ate your typing into an honest refusal. Filed as
`request_text_inside_a_form_xobject_cannot_be_edited_and_the_error_blames_the_text.md`
with three asks — a published "is this editable?" query, a distinct error for
"the pin matched no operator", and the real one: editing inside form XObjects.

**(b) — not yet driven.** Nothing claimed.

## O2 — Cut / copy / paste of PAGE CONTENT (`Ctrl+X` / `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V`)

**Asked:** first week, and repeatedly since. Restated 2026-08-20: *"can you get
cut copy and paste working for objects I select on the canvas?"*
**Scope set by you, 2026-08-20:** *"oh I might want all cases so we shouldn't be
restrictive in our ask."*
**Status:** OPEN — **blocked on the engine, and the full ask is now filed**:
`request_an_object_clipboard_the_whole_capability_not_the_convenient_subset.md`.

### What works today

- Markup and comments: cut, copy and paste, all three chords bound.
- Swept text: copy to the system clipboard.
- **Page content — a path, a line, a block of drawing:** nothing.
- A placed image: can be put in, cannot be picked back up.

And **nothing at all crosses a document boundary**, which matters now that you
have tabs and move pages between them.

### I nearly asked for a third of it

I was going to ask for `duplicate_objects` alone, on the argument that Ctrl+V in
one document decomposes into *duplicate + offset* and `move_objects` already
exists. That is true and it would have covered same-document duplication only —
not pasting into the other tab, not the system clipboard, not dimensions or form
fields. You stopped that, and the filed request is the whole capability:

1. **A portable object payload** — content *and* the resources it depends on.
   Kind-agnostic, so a mixed selection works; takes a `Matrix`, so paste-in-place,
   paste-offset, paste-scaled and paste-rotated are one verb; with a preflight so
   the menu item can be greyed rather than discovering the refusal by pressing.
2. **Serialisable**, which is what makes cross-document and cross-session paste
   fall out instead of being a second feature.
3. **The system clipboard** — a pdfce-private format so pdfce→pdfce is lossless,
   plus a standalone PDF and an image so SolidWorks and your CAD packages can
   read it. Registering those is mine; I need the bytes from them.
4. **Cut as one undo entry**, or Ctrl+X then Ctrl+Z gives your objects back and
   leaves the clipboard changed.
5. **Dimensions and form fields refuse loudly** rather than pasting something
   subtly broken — a pasted dimension needs a sidecar record and a group, a
   pasted field needs a name that does not collide. Silent partial success is
   the one outcome I cannot work with.

**Reading vector data IN from other programs** (paste from Illustrator) is
explicitly *not* in the ask — that is foreign PDF/EMF/SVG parsing and a much
larger job. Named so it is a decision rather than an omission. Say the word if
you want it.

### ★ The finding that makes this smaller than it looks

`EditSession::import_object` already exists, privately: a recursive
cross-document object-graph copy with fresh object numbers, every reference
remapped, cycles handled, and stream payloads re-staged. It is what
`insert_pages` and `merge_document` use to bring pages across **with their
fonts, patterns, images and soft masks intact**.

That is the entire difficulty of pasting page content, already solved. The ask
is not "build a copy engine" — it is "expose the one you have at object
granularity."

**Sits below the transform verbs in priority**, deliberately: an operator who
can place an image and not move it is worse off than one who cannot copy a path.
The first is a feature that looks broken; the second is one that is absent.

## O3 — Perimeter measuring tool

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — click around to make a shape, sum the segment lengths
into one dimension; right-click to add segments; drag the endpoints to adjust
the shape; all the scaling options of the other dimension tools.
**Status:** OPEN — **and no longer blocked.** Filed 2026-08-20; the engine
shipped the whole thing the same day (commits `9940acf`, `ae06440`): a
`Perimeter` kind carrying its vertices and an open/closed flag, verbs to move,
insert and remove a vertex, and a preflight so a right-click menu can be greyed
correctly rather than by guessing.

The value goes through the same group path as every other dimension, so scale,
unit, precision, drafting standard and layer come free. The label sits at the
vertex centroid, so it drifts smoothly when you drag a corner instead of
teleporting across the shape.

**SHIPPED 2026-08-20 and DRIVEN.** Measure ▸ Perimeter arms a tool; click
around the shape; the polyline previews as you go with a rubber band to the
cursor; the Tool panel shows the running total in the group's own units;
clicking the first point closes the ring and commits; double-click finishes an
open path; `measure.finish` on the ribbon does the same.

It is a real dimension in a real group, so the scale, unit, number format,
drafting standard, layer and style cascade all apply exactly as they do to a
linear dimension — which is the half you asked about specifically.

Driven on the benchmark sheet by `measure_perimeter_traces_and_closes`:

```
Measure ▸ Perimeter armed the tool
four vertices taken; running total: -0.0 → 378.8 → 655.8 → 1023.6
★ the ring closed and the dimension reached the engine: add-dimension page=0 n=1
```

The first driven run FAILED, correctly: the ring would not close, by eight
canvas units. The first vertex is stored where the *snap* put it, so the closing
click was being measured against a target that had already moved — and it was
being measured with the click tolerance instead of the snap tolerance. Fixed.

**Dragging the endpoints SHIPPED 2026-08-20 and is driven.** Select a perimeter
and its corners get handles; drag one and the shape follows, previewed as you
go. The status row reports what it cost you:

```
That corner changed the measurement: 621.45 pt is now 1226.84 pt.
```

Both numbers, because you can see the new one and cannot see the old one — the
geometry it came from is gone. Silent when the number did not move, so the line
means something when it appears.

You can also drag a perimeter's **number** now, the same way as a linear
dimension's — and more freely, because a perimeter's label is anchored in page
axes rather than to an axis, so it lands where you drop it instead of being
flattened onto a line.

**Still open in this row:** right-click a segment to add a point, right-click a
point to remove one. Both engine verbs exist, and so does the preflight that
tells a menu whether to grey the item, so this is shell work only.

## O4 — Insert image does nothing

**Asked:** 2026-08-19, restated 2026-08-20 — *"No it always hasn't worked."*
**Status:** **BOTH CAUSES FIXED 2026-08-20.** Awaiting your verdict.

You were right, twice, and it was never a misunderstanding. There were two
separate defects sitting on top of each other:

**The engine's.** `add_image` corrupted the page's `/Contents` whenever it was
an indirect reference to an array — which is what every CAD-exported sheet uses.
The verb returned success, the status bar reported the resolution, the picture
was not on the page, and **the saved file could not be reopened by pdfce at
all**. Filed with an eight-line repro; fixed in `Pass 111.0`. Files already
damaged by an older build now open, render, and say so through a counted
disclosure rather than being silently patched.

Verified here, headlessly, on your benchmark drawing:

```
pages BEFORE: Ok(1)
pages AFTER:  Ok(1)     ← was Err("/Contents is neither a stream nor an array")
reloaded:     Ok(1)
```

**Mine.** The shell re-walked the page tree after every edit and returned early
when the page's object id had not moved — with a comment claiming *"the page
vector already describes the document"*. False: a `Page` carries its `/Contents`
and `/Resources`, and `add_image` changes what `/Contents` **is**. So the canvas
and the object tree went on reading the page as it was before the edit. That is
row O13, fixed the same day and driven.

Between them they explain everything you reported, including why saving and
reopening showed the picture: the bytes were right the whole time.

## O7 — Selecting text inside a draft

**Asked:** not by you. Recorded 2026-08-20 because it is the obvious next thing
after the caret and I would rather name the gap than leave it implied.

Shift+arrow, Ctrl+A, and dragging across a draft to select part of it, so that
typing replaces the selection. Not started.

## O5 — Horizontal / vertical dimension constraint, from a drop-down

**Asked:** 2026-08-20.
**Status:** OPEN, not started. `LinearPick::constraint` exists in the shell and
is never written outside tests — there is no control for it. No engine work
needed.

## O6 — The scale ratio field follows the dimension you set

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"when I set the dimension the editable ratio one shown
should change to match it."*
**Status:** OPEN, not started.

---

# SHIPPED — awaiting your verdict

Rows here are built, gated and driven. **They stay here until you have used
them and said so**, then they move to CLOSED with the date you confirmed.

## S1 — Move a placed dimension, with a live preview

**Asked:** 2026-08-20. **Shipped:** 2026-08-20, commit `469d4d7`.
Press inside a selected ce dimension and drag: the dimension line follows,
previewed from the same function a committed dimension is drawn from, and the
release commits `place_dimension`. The measured points never move, so the
printed number cannot change. Linear dimensions only — angular refuses at the
press rather than starting a drag that could not finish.
**Verified:** unit tests only (4). **NOT yet driven through the harness.**

## S2 — The measure sidebar no longer hides half its controls

**Asked:** 2026-08-20. **Shipped:** 2026-08-20, commit `c2de963`.
The group list was a four-column grid 209 pt wider than its own column, clipped
with no scrollbar in that axis. Now a block per group, and the panel measures
its own overflow so it cannot come back quietly.
**Verified:** `no_row_in_this_panel_outruns_a_narrow_dock`, which failed at
209 pt before the change. **NOT yet looked at on screen.**

## S3 — `Ctrl+P` opens Print

**Asked:** 2026-08-20. **Shipped:** 2026-08-20.
It had never been bound. Print was on the ribbon, in the QAT and in a menu, so
every surface that lists commands showed it and only the keyboard did not.
