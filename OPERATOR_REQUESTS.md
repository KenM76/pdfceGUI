# Operator requests — the standing backlog

> **Ken, 2026-08-20:** *"Where do you need to put these requests so they just
> get auto-repeated over and over again so I don't have to keep requesting they
> be done over and over again?"*

**Here.** This file is the answer, and this section is the contract.

## The contract

1. **Every request you make goes in this file, the moment you make it**, before
   any work starts on it. Not into a chat reply, not into a session summary,
   not into an agent's memory — into this file, which is in git, on disk,
   backed up, and read at the start of every session.
2. **Only you close a row.** I may move a row to *shipped-and-driven*; the row
   does not leave this file until you have used it and said so. A row I believe
   is done but you have not confirmed sits under **Shipped — awaiting your
   verdict**, not deleted.
3. **A row carries evidence, not a claim.** *"Done"* is not a status. The
   status is either a driven check by name, or a dated note saying exactly what
   was verified and how. If nobody drove it, it says NOT VERIFIED, in those
   words.
4. **A blocked row names what blocks it and where that is filed.** If it is an
   engine gap, the row names the file in
   `D:\Dev\FeatureRequests\pdfce_FeatureRequests\open\`. A row that says
   "blocked" with nothing behind it is a row I have not done the work on.
5. **Nothing is silently rescoped.** If I ship half of what you asked for, the
   row stays open and says which half.

## Why this file and not something cleverer

The failure this fixes is real and it is mine: a request made in conversation
lives exactly as long as the conversation. Sessions end, context is compacted,
and an ask made in turn three of a long session is gone by turn thirty — which
is why you have had to repeat yourself. The agent-memory system is for *how you
work*; it is the wrong shape for *what you asked for*, because memories get
summarised and requests must not.

A file in the repository has none of those properties. It is read at session
start alongside `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, it survives compaction because it is on
disk, and its history is in git so a row cannot quietly disappear.

# ★★★ THE OPERATOR'S CURRENT DIRECTION — 2026-08-20

> *"put the text editing aside again. In the next version I just need the
> perimeter measuring tool to work with the group scale stuff the same as the
> other dimensioning tools have."*

**O1 is PARKED at his instruction.** Not closed, not solved — parked. The
findings stand and the engine request stays open. Do not pick it back up
without him.

**O3, the perimeter tool, is the single deliverable for the next build.** The
engine shipped its whole half on 2026-08-20; everything left is shell work.

## And the standing criticism, recorded rather than argued with

> *"We'll have to reconsider how you are going about the canvas later since it
> shouldn't take multiple 3 hour sessions each day to figure out how to get a
> cursor to move and edit text on it, or get shortcuts to work for basic
> functions."*

He is right and this belongs at the top of the file where it cannot be missed.
Two observations that are mine to act on, not his to have to make again:

1. **The basics were never audited as basics.** Ctrl+P had never been bound. A
   text caret had no index. Both are things every application in this class has
   on day one, and both were found by him rather than by us — because every
   test asked "does the thing I built work?" and nothing asked "does the thing
   everyone expects exist?". The keymap now has a list-shaped gate for exactly
   this reason. The canvas needs the same treatment and does not have it yet.
2. **Sessions have been spent diagnosing, not building.** Three of today's
   findings were engine defects that presented as shell defects, and each cost
   hours to localise. That is partly the boundary and partly that the driven
   checks were reading traces rather than pixels — a trace can say the verb ran
   and cannot say the screen changed. Two checks were fixed today to stop
   producing confident wrong diagnoses. That is the pattern to keep pulling on.

# OPEN

## O8 — **A Save button.** Not Save As. Save.

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"can I please have a save button like every other
program in existence has? We're on week two of this and just have a save as
button."*
**Status:** **SHIPPED 2026-08-20 and DRIVEN.** Awaiting your verdict.

`Ctrl+S` saves over the file you opened. `Ctrl+Shift+S` is Save-a-copy. The
quick-access toolbar's second slot is Save now, and it carries the disk glyph;
Save-a-copy renders as text.

It writes to a temporary beside your file and then renames, so a crash or a full
disk in the middle leaves your original untouched rather than half-written. And
because pdfce saves incrementally, the previous version of the document stays
inside the file — nothing is thrown away by pressing it.

Driven: `save_writes_over_the_file_you_opened` — the file grew 140,660 →
141,423 bytes, no temporary was left behind, and it still reads as a page tree.

★ The blocker that kept this out for a fortnight said *"in-place save is blocked
on autosave and crash recovery"*. That was aimed at the wrong hazard: pdfce's
incremental format already WAS the crash recovery. What was actually unsafe was
the write, and that has a three-line answer nobody had written because nobody
was asking. Third time in two days that a blocker turned out to be a question
asked wrongly.

There is no defence for how long it took. `Ctrl+S` is bound to `file.save_copy`, which asks where to
put it, every time. Overwrite-in-place was written down as *"an operator scope
decision"* and then sat there being nobody's problem — which is the same failure
as `Ctrl+P` never being bound and the caret never having an index: **the basics
were never audited as basics**, because every test asked "does the thing I built
work?" and nothing asked "does the thing everyone expects exist?".

## O9 — A **length** tool: the perimeter tool that never closes

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"add a length tool that works like the perimeter tool
without needing to close the profile."*
**Status:** OPEN.

The machinery already does open paths (double-click finishes one). What is
missing is that it is *reachable as its own tool* — "Perimeter" says closed, so
nobody measuring a pipe run or a cable route would think to reach for it.

## O10 — Neither measuring tool previews while you trace

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"both these tools need a preview just like the measure
tool has."*
**Status:** **FIXED 2026-08-20**, awaiting your verdict.

The preview arm was written and unit-tested for its segments, and it was
**unreachable**: `super::preview` returns early on
`MeasureState::gesture_in_progress()`, and that function had not learned about
the perimeter's pick. So the tool drew nothing at all while tracing.

It is the failure class this project keeps meeting — every part correct, the
*join* unobserved — and the driven check could not see it, because that check
asserts on the trace and a preview is pixels. `every_pick_kind_is_counted_as_a_gesture`
is now the guard.

## O11 — Move, resize and rotate a placed image on the canvas

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"there was no way to reposition, resize, or rotate it
on the screen. Can I please please please have that too?"*
**Status:** OPEN.

## O12 — Move text after placing it

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"can I please please please have the capability to move
the text after?"*
**Status:** OPEN. Same family as O11: direct manipulation of placed content.

## O13 — Insert image does not appear until you save and reopen

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"I tried a new document and inserted an image. Nothing
appeared on screen or in the tree, but after saving and reopening the image was
there."*
**Status:** OPEN, and this is **new evidence that splits O4 in two.**

O4 is the engine corrupting `/Contents` when it is an indirect array — that one
produces a file pdfce cannot reopen at all. Your new document reopened fine and
had the image in it, so the write was correct and **the in-session view never
updated**. That is a second, shell-side defect: the canvas and the object tree
kept describing the pre-edit page.

"Nothing on screen or in the tree" is the important half — the tree reads the
decomposition, so both surfaces are downstream of one stale cache.


## O1 — Editing text on the canvas, and editing text in a text box

**Asked:** repeatedly; restated 2026-08-20 — *"Still no editing text on top of
the canvas. Or editing text on a text box."*
**Status:** OPEN. Under investigation 2026-08-20; nothing claimed.

Two distinct things and I have been conflating them, which is probably part of
why it keeps coming back:

- **(a) Editing text that is already on the page** — click a run of existing
  page text, get a caret, retype it.
- **(b) Editing the text inside a text box you have added** — a `/FreeText`
  annotation, or a text object this shell authored: double-click it, get a
  caret in it, retype.

**(a) — driven 2026-08-20 on your own CAD drawing. It is reproduced, and it is
not the shell.** `text_edit_on_a_real_drawing`:

```
text-edit-caret kind=Edit page=0 run=44 len=1     ← the caret lands on real text
text-edit-typing draft=true text_events=1 len=2   ← keystrokes reach the draft
text-edit-typing draft=true text_events=1 len=3
text-edit-plan page=0 run=44 disposition=Pin reason=Rotated pinned=true
edit-text-refused page=0 n=1
  detail=text to edit ("p") was not found in an editable run on the page
```

So the tool arms, the caret lands on the right run, the typing arrives, the plan
is built and the commit reaches the engine — **and `pdfce-core` refuses it.**
From your chair that is precisely "the tool responds and the page does not
change".

Root cause under investigation 2026-08-20. It will be either an engine gap (a
request, filed) or a wrong call on my side (a fix). Either way this row records
the answer.

★ And a second defect found in the process, on my side: the driven check for
this was reporting *"THE COMMIT NEVER REACHED THE ENGINE"* — which was **false**.
`edit-text-refused` is not `edit-text`, so a check asserting on the absence of a
line produced a confident, specific, wrong accusation about working code. Fixed:
a refusal is now asked about first and quoted verbatim.

**(c) — the caret cannot be moved inside a run. FIXED 2026-08-20**, and it was
worse than it looked: there was **no caret index at all**. The draft appended
text and Backspace popped the last character, so the painter drew its line at
the right edge of the run's box because that is the only position an
append-only draft has.

Now: a real caret. Click part-way into a run and it lands at that character
(measured against the run's own glyph advances); Left, Right, Home, End,
Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right move it; Delete eats forwards; typing and Backspace
act at the caret. Unit-tested, including your `SHEET 1 OF 4` case as a named
test. **NOT yet driven** — the harness was blocked by the on-screen keyboard.

**No selection yet** — no Shift+arrow, no Ctrl+A, no drag-select inside a
draft. That is a second feature and it is row **O7** rather than an implied gap.

**(a) — the cause is found, and it is the engine.** Your text lives inside a
form XObject; `pdfce-core` edits page-stream text only, which is a named
non-goal of that cut. The shell was reading the byte span of a show operator
and discarding the field that says *which content stream the span indexes*, so
it pinned into the wrong buffer and the engine reported "text not found" about
text that was plainly there.

Measured on the benchmark drawing: **1,696 show operators of real drawing text
inside the form, against 3,007 metadata glyphs in the page's own stream.** So
on your documents this is the majority case, not an edge case — which is why it
has read as "does nothing" every time.

Shipped today, and it is not a fix: the caret is now **refused before it takes
a keystroke**, with a sentence on the status row. That converts a caret that
silently ate your typing into an honest refusal. Filed as
`request_text_inside_a_form_xobject_cannot_be_edited_and_the_error_blames_the_text.md`
with three asks — a published "is this editable?" query, a distinct error for
"the pin matched no operator", and the real one: editing inside form XObjects.

**(b) — not yet driven.** Nothing claimed.

## O2 — Cut / copy / paste of PAGE CONTENT (`Ctrl+X` / `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V`)

**Asked:** repeatedly; restated 2026-08-20.
**Status:** OPEN — partially shipped, and the part that is missing is the part
you are pressing the key for.

- Markup / comments: **works** (`edit.cut`, `edit.copy`, `edit.paste`, all
  three chords bound and driven).
- Swept text: **works** (copy to the system clipboard).
- **Page content — a path, a line, a block of drawing:** refused. The
  refusal is a sentence on the status row, which from your chair reads as
  "the shortcut does nothing".
- A placed image: can be pasted in, cannot be picked back up.

**Blocked by the engine.** `pdfce-core` has no verb that inserts page content;
this was measured over `edit.rs` and the narrower half was corrected on
2026-08-19 (`note_correcting_our_own_clipboard_blocker_and_one_small_ask.md`).
The note ended *"we are not asking for it yet"* — **that was my call to make and
it was the wrong one**, because you had already asked. A proper request is owed
and this row is not closed until the round trip works on a path.

## O3 — Perimeter measuring tool

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — click around to make a shape, sum the segment lengths
into one dimension; right-click to add segments; drag the endpoints to adjust
the shape; all the scaling options of the other dimension tools.
**Status:** OPEN — **and no longer blocked.** Filed 2026-08-20; the engine
shipped the whole thing the same day (commits `9940acf`, `ae06440`): a
`Perimeter` kind carrying its vertices and an open/closed flag, verbs to move,
insert and remove a vertex, and a preflight so a right-click menu can be greyed
correctly rather than by guessing.

The value goes through the same group path as every other dimension, so scale,
unit, precision, drafting standard and layer come free. The label sits at the
vertex centroid, so it drifts smoothly when you drag a corner instead of
teleporting across the shape.

**SHIPPED 2026-08-20 and DRIVEN.** Measure ▸ Perimeter arms a tool; click
around the shape; the polyline previews as you go with a rubber band to the
cursor; the Tool panel shows the running total in the group's own units;
clicking the first point closes the ring and commits; double-click finishes an
open path; `measure.finish` on the ribbon does the same.

It is a real dimension in a real group, so the scale, unit, number format,
drafting standard, layer and style cascade all apply exactly as they do to a
linear dimension — which is the half you asked about specifically.

Driven on the benchmark sheet by `measure_perimeter_traces_and_closes`:

```
Measure ▸ Perimeter armed the tool
four vertices taken; running total: -0.0 → 378.8 → 655.8 → 1023.6
★ the ring closed and the dimension reached the engine: add-dimension page=0 n=1
```

The first driven run FAILED, correctly: the ring would not close, by eight
canvas units. The first vertex is stored where the *snap* put it, so the closing
click was being measured against a target that had already moved — and it was
being measured with the click tolerance instead of the snap tolerance. Fixed.

**Still open in this row, and it is the rest of your ask:** right-click to add a
segment, right-click to remove a vertex, and dragging the endpoints to adjust
the shape. All four engine verbs exist. That is editing a *committed* dimension
rather than authoring one, so it goes beside the dimension-drag work.

## O4 — Insert image does nothing

**Asked:** 2026-08-19, restated 2026-08-20 — *"No it always hasn't worked."*
**Status:** OPEN, **cause found 2026-08-20**, blocked on the engine.

You were right and it was never a misunderstanding. `EditSession::add_image`
returns success, the status bar reports the resolution, and the picture is not
on the page — because `add_image` corrupts the page's `/Contents` when it is an
indirect reference to an array, which is what every CAD-exported sheet uses.
The saved file then cannot be reopened by pdfce at all.

Eight-line repro and the exact bytes are in
`request_add_image_corrupts_a_page_whose_contents_is_an_indirect_array.md`.
Works on a page whose `/Contents` is a plain stream; fails on one whose
`/Contents` is an array. That is the entire difference.

## O7 — Selecting text inside a draft

**Asked:** not by you. Recorded 2026-08-20 because it is the obvious next thing
after the caret and I would rather name the gap than leave it implied.

Shift+arrow, Ctrl+A, and dragging across a draft to select part of it, so that
typing replaces the selection. Not started.

## O5 — Horizontal / vertical dimension constraint, from a drop-down

**Asked:** 2026-08-20.
**Status:** OPEN, not started. `LinearPick::constraint` exists in the shell and
is never written outside tests — there is no control for it. No engine work
needed.

## O6 — The scale ratio field follows the dimension you set

**Asked:** 2026-08-20 — *"when I set the dimension the editable ratio one shown
should change to match it."*
**Status:** OPEN, not started.

# SHIPPED — awaiting your verdict

Rows here are built, gated and driven. **They stay here until you have used
them and said so**, then they move to CLOSED with the date you confirmed.

## S1 — Move a placed dimension, with a live preview

**Asked:** 2026-08-20. **Shipped:** 2026-08-20, commit `469d4d7`.
Press inside a selected ce dimension and drag: the dimension line follows,
previewed from the same function a committed dimension is drawn from, and the
release commits `place_dimension`. The measured points never move, so the
printed number cannot change. Linear dimensions only — angular refuses at the
press rather than starting a drag that could not finish.
**Verified:** unit tests only (4). **NOT yet driven through the harness.**

## S2 — The measure sidebar no longer hides half its controls

**Asked:** 2026-08-20. **Shipped:** 2026-08-20, commit `c2de963`.
The group list was a four-column grid 209 pt wider than its own column, clipped
with no scrollbar in that axis. Now a block per group, and the panel measures
its own overflow so it cannot come back quietly.
**Verified:** `no_row_in_this_panel_outruns_a_narrow_dock`, which failed at
209 pt before the change. **NOT yet looked at on screen.**

## S3 — `Ctrl+P` opens Print

**Asked:** 2026-08-20. **Shipped:** 2026-08-20.
It had never been bound. Print was on the ribbon, in the QAT and in a menu, so
every surface that lists commands showed it and only the keyboard did not.
`the_keymap_offers_the_chords_a_document_application_must` now asserts the whole
list of universal chords rather than this one line.
**Verified:** unit test. **NOT yet driven.**

## S4 — Imperial sheet sizes

**Asked:** 2026-08-19. **Shipped:** 2026-08-19, commit `815036a`.

## S5 — Multiple documents, page drag between them, tab reorder

**Asked:** 2026-08-19/20. **Shipped:** 2026-08-20.
**Verified:** driven — `document_tabs`, `page_drag_between_documents`,
`tab_reorder`.
