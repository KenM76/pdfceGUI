//! # viewer — the page-view state machine and its geometry
//!
//! **Salvaged from `D:\Dev\pdfce\crates\pdfce-gui\src\viewer.rs`** (Class A,
//! `SALVAGE.md`: 509 code lines, 413 test lines, *"zoom ladder with provable
//! reversibility, fit modes re-derived per frame, per-page raster ceiling
//! accounting for `pixels_per_point`. Well tested."*). Carried across with
//! its documentation and its entire test suite intact, per the salvage
//! procedure's rule that a snippet leaves the reasoning behind and the next
//! engineer re-derives a decision that was already paid for.
//!
//! Changes made during salvage, and only these:
//!
//! - `use eframe::egui::…` became `use egui::…` — this crate names `egui`
//!   directly (see `Cargo.toml`), so the re-export hop is gone.
//! - Two functions that have no consumer until stage S4 gained an explicit
//!   `#[allow(dead_code, reason = …)]`, in the same shape the original
//!   already used for its own not-yet-called geometry bridges. They are
//!   kept rather than deleted because they are the *pair* of a live
//!   function, and a bridge with only one direction implemented is how the
//!   two ends drift apart.
//! - Nothing else. No arithmetic changed, no test was weakened.
//!
//! **Phase 4 landed the page *range*, and it is not a field here.** This
//! module's own known-future-work note used to read *"a page range rather than
//! a single `page_index` (`GUI_ROADMAP` Phase 4.1, the continuous-scroll
//! prerequisite)"*, and the answer turned out to be that a range is not
//! something a view *holds*. Which pages are on screen falls out of where the
//! pages are laid out and where the viewport is, so [`strip`] computes it and
//! [`ViewState`] keeps exactly one index — now meaning *"the page the operator
//! is looking at"*, derived from the scroll position under a continuous mode
//! and set by navigation under a paged one. See [`strip::Strip::page_at_view`].
//!
//! What [`ViewState`] did gain is [`ViewState::display`]: which of the four
//! arrangements is active. It is a fourth axis of the view, orthogonal to the
//! three below, and it is documented in [`display`].
//!
//! **Phase 3.1 is done and it needed nothing from this module.** Anchoring a
//! zoom is a question about the *scroll offset*, not about the ladder, so the
//! rule and the solve live in [`crate::canvas::zoom`] and
//! [`crate::canvas::geometry`]. Two things here are reused rather than
//! reimplemented, and that reuse is the point:
//!
//! * [`fit_scale`] under [`FitMode::Page`] computes the scale that frames a
//!   **region** for zoom-to-selection and marquee-zoom, exactly as it computes
//!   the scale that frames a page. One derivation, so a region zoom and a page
//!   fit cannot disagree about what "fits" means;
//! * [`max_zoom_for_page`] and [`clamp_zoom`] apply the per-page raster
//!   ceiling to a framing zoom. A marquee dragged around a bolt head asks for
//!   a scale no page-sized pixmap can supply, and the answer is the same
//!   answer the zoom buttons give — stop at the ceiling, and let the status
//!   bar's readout state the scale that was actually pinned.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Everything about "which page am I looking at, and how big is it on
//! screen" lives here, deliberately separated from the egui widget code.
//! The split exists for one concrete reason: **this module is unit-testable
//! and the widget code is not.** A windowed UI cannot be exercised
//! headlessly on a CI runner, but zoom-ladder arithmetic, fit-scale
//! derivation, page-index clamping and the raster-size ceiling are exactly
//! the parts where an off-by-one or a divide-by-zero would show up as a
//! user-visible bug — so they are pure functions with tests, and the widget
//! code is reduced to wiring.
//!
//! ## The view model
//!
//! [`ViewState`] carries three things:
//!
//! - `page_index` — 0-based into the flattened page vector from
//!   [`pdfce_core::page_tree::pages`]. The UI displays it 1-based; the
//!   conversion happens once, in the string catalog.
//! - `zoom` — the **effective** scale in device pixels per PDF user-space
//!   unit, which is precisely the `scale` argument
//!   [`pdfce_render::render_page`] takes. `1.0` is 72 DPI, i.e. "actual
//!   size" on a nominal 72-point-per-inch display.
//! - `fit` — whether `zoom` is a value the operator pinned
//!   ([`FitMode::None`]) or one derived from the viewport each frame
//!   ([`FitMode::Page`] / [`FitMode::Width`]). This is a *mode*, not a
//!   one-shot action: "Fit page" that stops fitting the moment the window
//!   is resized is the behaviour every viewer gets right and would be
//!   conspicuous to get wrong.
//!
//! ## Why the zoom ladder is a table, not a multiplier
//!
//! Repeatedly multiplying by, say, √2 produces zoom levels like 141%,
//! 199%, 281% — technically fine, but the operator can never get back to
//! a round number, and two different click sequences that "should" land
//! on 100% land on 99.6% and 100.4% instead. A fixed ladder of familiar
//! percentages ([`ZOOM_LADDER`]) makes zoom-in/zoom-out exactly
//! reversible and always lands somewhere nameable. Zoom values *off* the
//! ladder (from ctrl+scroll, or from a fit mode) are handled by taking
//! the next rung strictly above/below the current value, so the ladder
//! also acts as a "snap back to sanity" mechanism.
//!
//! ## The raster-size ceiling is a real constraint, not a formality
//!
//! `pdfce-render` refuses to allocate a pixmap with an edge over
//! [`pdfce_render::MAX_PIXMAP_EDGE`] (16,384 px — the allocation guard). A
//! letter page never comes close, but ISO 32000-1 Annex C permits pages up
//! to 14,400 units on an edge, and such a page hits the ceiling at about
//! 1.1× zoom. Rather than let the operator zoom into an error message,
//! [`max_zoom_for_page`] lowers the ceiling per page and [`ViewState`]
//! clamps against it — the zoom buttons simply stop, which is
//! self-explanatory in a way that "requested raster size 115200x86400 is
//! empty or exceeds MAX_PIXMAP_EDGE" is not.

// Which of the four page-display arrangements is active, the spread rule the
// facing ones use, and the per-mode default that makes Read continuous.

//   convert between the screen and this space; they carry NO rotation logic
//   (rotation is already baked into the `extent` they are handed — see
//   [`page_extent_pts`]).
// - **PDF user space** — Y-**up**, origin at the *un-rotated*
//   MediaBox/CropBox lower-left, exactly what an annotation `/Rect`, a
//   content-stream operand, or the object model expresses. The second
//   bridge, `canvas_to_pdf_space`/`pdf_space_to_canvas`, converts between
//   canvas space and this one by reusing — and inverting — the SAME device
//   transform [`pdfce_render::page_device_geometry`] computes to rasterize
//   the page, so the interaction geometry and the render agree by
//   construction rather than by two hand-derived rotation formulas quietly
//   drifting apart.

/// Map a screen point to **canvas space**.
///
/// `image_rect` is the canvas Response's own `.rect` for this frame

/// width/height); `zoom` is [`ViewState::zoom`]. The page raster is drawn
/// at `image_rect.min` scaled by `zoom`, so undoing that — subtract the
/// origin, divide by the zoom — is the whole of the arithmetic.
///
/// **No rotation branch lives here on purpose.** Rotation-correctness comes
/// entirely from `extent` already carrying the rotated width/height (see
/// [`page_extent_pts`]); adding a rotation-aware branch here as well would
